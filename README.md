## My process
- I started with the mobile design first. I tested out the layout using divs with background colors first.
- I then inserted the content into the divs. I used CSS Grid for the image and text containers so that they resized accordingly with the screen size.
- I then started working on the desktop design. Using Grid made it easy to change the layout of the containers. I still had to go back and forth a few times to get the spacing of items correct.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- It was my first time trying out mobile-first workflow. I gained a lot of experience from this and understood the importance of media queries.
- I also gained experience in using CSS Grid.
- I learnt about using background images more.
